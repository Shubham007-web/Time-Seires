# Time-Seires
In this repository, I added time-series forcasting and data analysis. Time Series Data Analysis is a way of studying the characteristics of the response variable with respect to time as the independent variable.
- A Time-Series represents a series of time-based orders. It would be Years, Months, Weeks, Days, Horus, Minutes, and Seconds. It is an observation from the sequence of discrete time of successive intervals.
